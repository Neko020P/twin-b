  Yes, I agree with this refined matching of research questions to research objectives. The pairings make logical sense and show clear connections between each research question and its corresponding objective.

	For Objective 1 (developing a model of energy consumption behavior), Research Question 1 directly addresses this by exploring how Digital Twin technology can reduce electricity consumption in the specific Boonchupanitthan building while maintaining comfort levels.

	For Objective 2 (studying methods for reducing electricity costs), both Research Questions 2 and 3 focus on comparing different control systems (AI-based HVAC vs. manual settings, and Reinforcement Learning vs. Rule-Based Control) to determine potential energy cost savings.

	For Objective 3 (creating a tool to identify high-energy usage areas), Research Question 6 addresses this by evaluating the accuracy of AI-Based Clustering methods (K-Means vs. DBSCAN) for identifying high energy consumption areas.

	For Objective 4 (assessing model accuracy through simulations), Research Questions 4 and 9 focus on evaluating the accuracy of the Digital Twin's machine learning algorithms and exploring the balance between accuracy loss and computational efficiency.

This matching provides a clear framework that ensures each research objective is addressed by specific, relevant research questions. The structure will help guide the research process effectively.
