### Objectives

1. To develop a model of the structure and energy consumption behavior in the Boonchupanitthan building for university executives to study energy-saving strategies.
2. To study methods for reducing electricity costs and saving energy at the university.
3. To create a tool that helps analyze and identify high-energy usage areas based on simulated scenarios derived from energy usage data extracted from historical data.
4. To assess the accuracy of the model through simulations using historical data.
### Analyze Factors Affecting the Problem

1️. **Constraints**

- **Budget**: Costs associated with installing sensors or using HPC on LANTA.
- **Time**: Data collection and model training to achieve accuracy may take a long time.
- **Equipment Used**: Energy measurement sensors, HVAC system, processing equipment.

2️. **Variables**

- **Energy Consumption (kWh)**
- **Energy Cost (THB)**
- **Environmental Conditions** (e.g., temperature, humidity, CO2 levels, etc.)
- **User Behavior** (e.g., number of people, usage time, activities, etc.)
- **System Settings** (e.g., AI-Based Control vs. Manual Control)

3️. **Multi-Objective Optimization**

- Aim to reduce energy without compromising comfort (Comfort Score ≥ 80/100).
- Aim for maximum accuracy in energy predictions (Model Accuracy ≥ 90%).
- Aim to reduce Peak Load while maintaining appropriate air quality.
